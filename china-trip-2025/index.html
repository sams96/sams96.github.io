back to her home country in 2 years, and my third trip there having been in 2017
and 2018. We spent most of our time in my wife&rsquo;s home city of Chengdu, while
also visited the nearby Chongqing and Guiyang. This post is a collection of my
thoughts and opinions on the places we visited, along with some photos I took
during the trip.</p><figure><img src=24008.avif alt="文殊 wen shu temple, Chengdu" loading=eager><figcaption><p><em>文殊 wen shu</em> temple, Chengdu</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=chengdu>Chengdu</h2><p>When I first went to Chengdu in 2018, I wasn&rsquo;t very interested in the place,
it&rsquo;s very flat and generally lacking in visual interest, but I did meet my wife
there so I do have a bit of a soft spot for the place. When I travel alone I
tend to spend most of my time just exploring and looking for interesting areas
to photograph, and Chengdu isn&rsquo;t great for that. Going back with my wife was
much different, she knew all the best spots and between her missing the food
she&rsquo;d grown up with and me having more of an interest than I did last time, we
spent a lot of time eating.</p><p>Chengdu is, in my mind, the best food city in the world when it comes to native
cuisine, not that I&rsquo;m claiming to be an expert in this regard. My favourites
were: <em>甜‍水‍面 tian shui mian</em>, thicky chewy noodles with a delicious
spicy sauce<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> – <em>钟‍水‍饺 zhong shui jiao</em>, simple pork dumplings with
a different but equally delicious spicy sauce<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> – and of course <em>火‍锅
huo guo</em>, or hot pot, where you get a big pot of spicy broth on a burner in the
middle of your table and a selection of meats and vegetables to cook in it.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><figure><img src=24101.avif alt="均隆滨河 jun long bin he Road, Chengdu" loading=lazy><figcaption><p><em>均隆滨河 jun long bin he</em> Road, Chengdu</p></figcaption></figure><p>There&rsquo;s also a recent boom of nice coffee shops and really good coffee in
Chengdu. It&rsquo;s not hard to find a specialist coffee shop, they almost always have
a choice of beans, and that choice almost always includes a sour and fruity
light roast which made me very happy – my top recommendation is <em>agua café</em>.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>
I found walking around Chengdu, particularly in the area near where we stayed,
around the <em>牛‍王‍庙 niu wang miao</em> metro station, I was constantly
seeing nice looking coffee shops, restaurants, and bars that I wanted to visit.
I have the same experience every time we visit Paris.</p><p>Getting around Chengdu is easy. The street layout feels like it was built with
the <em>superblocks</em> idea in mind. There&rsquo;s something of a grid of large roads, and
inside the blocks created by this grid are a maze of smaller much quieter
streets which are much more pleasant to walk on, if you can find a reasonable
route through. Crossing these large roads is a frustrating experience. First you
have to get across the slip lane with limited visibility around the corner and
where no cars will stop for you, then you&rsquo;re waiting multiple minutes on the
island with no shade and surrounded by people on scooters until you get to
cross. Chengdu&rsquo;s metro is amazing, the coverage is very good, the platforms tend
to be very close to ground level so it&rsquo;s quick to get to the trains, and it&rsquo;s
very fast and frequent.</p><figure><img src=24105.avif alt="People&rsquo;s park, Chengdu" loading=lazy><figcaption><p>People&rsquo;s park, Chengdu</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=the-train>The Train</h2><p>There&rsquo;s not much to complain about with China&rsquo;s high speed rail system. The
headline being the high speed, we took a train from Chengdu East Station to
Shapingba in Chongqing, travelling 299km in 62 minutes, which means we
<strong>averaged</strong> almost 300km/h. I also liked how my wife was able to choose seats
before booking our tickets, which meant if we weren&rsquo;t able to get seats next to
each other, we could just travel at a different time – and, we didn&rsquo;t try this
but, you can order food from a restaurant near a station you&rsquo;re stopping at to
be delivered to your seat.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of the more airport like experience of the stations. They tend to
be further towards the edge of the city, albeit much closer than an airport and
of course well connected by metro. You have to go through some security theatre
to get into the station which is annoying, especially for me carrying film that
I&rsquo;d like to avoid putting through the scanners (that said, they were always
happy to hand check it when asked). The check does tend to be quick and I never
saw much of a queue. The waiting area is usually a huge hall with a selection of
shops, quite a bit of seating, and rows of escalators to get down to platform
level. You can only go to the platform shortly before your departure, so there&rsquo;s
another queue to wait in and crowd to navigate to scan your ticket and board.</p><h2 id=chongqing>Chongqing</h2><figure><img src=24107.avif alt="朝天门 chao tian men Square, Chongqing" loading=lazy><figcaption><p><em>朝天门 chao tian men</em> Square, Chongqing</p></figcaption></figure><p>On my previous visit to Chongqing in 2018 I was really taken by the city. It is,
at least in terms of urban form and landscape, the total opposite of Chengdu.
Chongqing is a huge city built on almost mountainous terrain, at the confluence
of two large rivers. It often feels like everything is built on top of
everything else, you can be on the ground floor on one side of a building and
the 20th floor on the other side. I enjoy photographing how human infrastructure
interacts with nature and Chongqing is full of interesting examples of this.</p><p>During this visit I had less time to explore the odd corners of the city, but we
still got around a good bit. We repeated a walk I had done previously, going
from <em>李‍子‍坝 li zi ba</em> station (where the monorail passes through an
apartment building, which was very quiet in 2018 but now a busy tourist
attraction) up a steep hillside the eventually make it to the pagoda at the top
of <em>鹅‍岭 e ling</em> park. The route took us up steep sets of stairs past some
abandoned buildings, then into a wealthier hilltop neighbourhood, and finally
the park. For me, Chongqing is a city to be explored on foot, there&rsquo;s constantly
cool things to see and the terrain gives you interesting vantage points from
which to see them. This can, however, be a bit less fun when you consider the
weather. It can get very hot and very humid in Chongqing, it&rsquo;s considered one of
China&rsquo;s <em>oven cities</em>. When we were there in September it mercifully stayed in
the low 30s, but that heat combined with seemingly having to walk uphill to get
anywhere can be pretty brutal.</p><figure><img src=24206.avif alt="嘉陵 jia ling River, Chongqing" loading=lazy><figcaption><p><em>嘉陵 jia ling</em> River, Chongqing</p></figcaption></figure><p>Finding nice coffee in Chongqing wasn&rsquo;t so easy, multiple places we found online
and tried to visit weren&rsquo;t open when they said they were, which sometimes meant
quite a bit of walking around in the excessive heat. The best spot we found was
Guaguajun coffee on Daijia Alley, which also had a great view over the Jialing
River.</p><p>Chongqing has a huge metro system, including two monorail lines. Line 2 is
particularly scenic , following the south bank of the Jialing River for a
section. It can often still take quite a bit of effort to get to a train, with
deep stations and long corridors for transferring between lines, another impact
of the terrain. One station we visited, <em>红‍土‍地 hong tu di</em>, took 6
escalators to get down to platform level, and that&rsquo;s not even the deepest. We
went to <em>hong tu di</em> to experience another form of physical punishment enjoyed
by Chongqingers – their brutally spicy and mouth-numbing hot pot. Specifically
for a hot pot restaurant in a 500m long air raid shelter built during WWII.</p><figure><img src=24208.avif alt="长江 chang jiang River, Chongqing" loading=lazy><figcaption><p><em>长江 chang jiang</em> River, Chongqing</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=guiyang>Guiyang</h2><p>Guiyang is the only city we visited on this trip that I hadn&rsquo;t been to before.
It&rsquo;s significantly smaller than the other two I&rsquo;ve mentioned, with <em>just</em> 4.5
million people, compared to 16 and 11 million in Chengdu and Chongqing. I also
generally found it the least interesting of the three. Guiyang is built on
hills, but nowhere near to the degree that Chongqing is, so it doesn&rsquo;t really
give the same sorts of views. The streets are much narrower than those in
Chengdu and it doesn&rsquo;t have the same sort of super-block structure, but the
streets are still very car oriented so you end up with a pretty poor pedestrian
experience. What is interesting is the proliferation of pedestrian underpasses,
which exist under many four-way junctions around town, and these are often full of
shops. This is nice but to me the underpasses still make you feel second class
compared to cars.</p><figure><img src=24303.avif alt="南明 nan ming River, Guiyang" loading=lazy><figcaption><p><em>南明 nan ming</em> River, Guiyang</p></figcaption></figure><p>The reason to visit Guiyang is the food, it has a very distinct cuisine compared
to Chengdu and Chongqing (and the rest of China). We tried sour noodles, which
came with a bucket of raw, unpeeled garlic cloves on the table for you to chew
on – multiple different types of hot pot that I hadn&rsquo;t heard of before, one with
a bean flavoured soup base and another that was mostly just a big pot of
tomatoes and chicken – and the highlight was <em>烙‍锅 lao guo</em>, which is
conceptually very similar to Korean barbecue. You have a big hot pan on your
table to cook various meats and vegetables, with a bowl of spicy dip in the
centre.</p><p>Guiyang also has a lively specialty coffee scene, but at least in the short time
we spent there I didn&rsquo;t find any coffee I liked as much as what we were having
in Chengdu. We queued outside Captain George, which is the pioneer of specialty
coffee in Guiyang, but I didn&rsquo;t think it lived up to the hype.</p><figure><img src=24310.avif alt="南明 nan ming River, Guiyang" loading=lazy><figcaption><p><em>南明 nan ming</em> River, Guiyang</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=parting-thoughts>Parting Thoughts</h2><p>We had a great time on our trip, I particularly enjoyed Chengdu and would love
to go back, I still feel like there&rsquo;s a lot more exploring to do in Chongqing,
and I&rsquo;m very glad we went to Guiyang but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d go out of my way to
return.</p></br><p>Every photo in the series was shot on my Hasselblad 501c with either a 60mm
f/3.5 CF lens using Ilford HP5+ shot at ISO 800 and developed in Ilfotec HC
1:49 for 11 minutes. I scanned them with an Epson V800 and edited them in
darktable.</p></br><p>With thanks to my wife for making the trip what it was, as well as for helping
