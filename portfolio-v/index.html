move from the UK to Switzerland, which did give me a new place to explore and
photograph. Even with that I took a fraction of the number of photos I usually
take in a year in 2020, which left me with not much to choose from for this
selection. I chose to still put it together though because I like that this has
become somewhat of a yearly reflection (even if it does take me the better part
of the next year to put them together) and I thought that given it was somewhat
of an interesting year it could be nice to have this record.</p><p>Along with the reduced number of photos taken came a complete lack of work
towards any larger serious projects, although I have started a couple of
collections of images taken with my phone that could become something
eventually.</p><p><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/yd7762><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51756460272_d0dbb55af4_b.jpg alt="Grand Union Canal" loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Grand Union Canal</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/30dqGq><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51757537298_39b366a6ba_b.jpg alt="Worcester &amp;amp; Birmingham Canal I" loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Worcester & Birmingham Canal I</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/Q94Jj6><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51758163070_c2a4610804_b.jpg alt="Worcester &amp;amp; Birmingham Canal II" loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Worcester & Birmingham Canal II</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/6749TD><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51758163105_07dbeb35d4_b.jpg alt=Limmat loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Limmat</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/F0096H><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51757942799_04102a6905_b.jpg alt=Stockwald loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Stockwald</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ss9679/50916521992/in/photostream/><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50916521992_ec5ba88608_b.jpg alt=Melchsee loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Melchsee</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ss9679/50965974786/in/photostream/><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50965974786_5a28eb24c3_b.jpg alt=Bettenalp loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Bettenalp</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/682TLp><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51757293141_f59201dd7e_b.jpg alt="Balconies I" loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Balconies I</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/q1900J><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51757942899_027e6c0f68_b.jpg alt="Balconies II" loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Balconies II</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/r841q4><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51757537508_ce191f1a6f_b.jpg alt="Siedlung Langgrüt" loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Siedlung Langgrüt</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ss9679/50982876137/in/photostream/><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50982876137_06b38db456_b.jpg alt="Fernsehturm Uetliburg" loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Fernsehturm Uetliburg</p></figcaption></figure><figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/m2VP7S><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51756460572_ec3a8c06aa_b.jpg alt="Schlittelweg Üetliberg" loading=lazy></a><figcaption><p>Schlittelweg Üetliberg</p></figcaption></figure></p><p>This year actually came with a change in equipment. I swapped out my Hasselblad
500C/M for a newer 501C, and with the change gained an 80mm CB lens, which which
all but one of the above images were taken. I did however stick with the trusty
Ilford HP5+ throughout, all shot at 400 except the last two which were at 800.</p></div><div class=article-info><div class=article-taxonomies><ul class=article-categories><li><a href=https://sams96.github.io/categories/photography>photography</a></li></ul><ul class=article-tags><li><a href=https://sams96.github.io/tags/portfolio>#portfolio</a></li></ul></div></div><meta name=fediverse:creator content="@mondoman712@toot.io"></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>© Sam Smith, 2025</p><nav><a href=/tags/ title=Tags>Tags</a>
