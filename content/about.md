### This Site

I use this blog to post about whatever I find interesting, which so far has been
{{< catlist >}}If you want to follow, I recommend using RSS. I have a feed for
the whole site [here](/index.xml), and for each [category](/categories/) and
[Tag](/tags/) that can be found on their respective pages. Personally I use
[ReadYou](https://github.com/ReadYouApp/ReadYou), but many others are available.
You could also get updates by email by feeding the RSS links into a service like
[feedrabbit](https://feedrabbit.com/) or [RSS by email](https://rssby.email/).

This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a modified
[Anubis](https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis) theme (with credit to
the [monochrome](https://github.com/dyutibarma/monochrome) which this site used
to be based on, [leejo.github.io](https://leejo.github.io) and the default
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) theme which were all inspirations for
this theme), and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Everything on this website is entirely my own work, unless otherwise mentioned.
I do not use large language models to write any text, and all images are
produced and edited without the assistance of any "AI".
