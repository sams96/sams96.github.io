This is the remnants of a failed attempt at a photo project looking at
Birmingham's pedestrian subways. I never really thought it was a very good idea
for a project but I decided to give it a go anyway because I wanted to try
shooting a project and it was the best idea that I had, also the subways are the
sort of thing that I usually like to shoot anyway.

Everything in this series was shot with my Hasselblad 500C/M and Zeiss 60mm
Distagon CF with Ilford HP5+ rated at 800 and developed with Kodak HC-110 at a
dilution of 1+49 for 11 minutes. This is what I shoot most of the time anyway
but I thought that the pushed HP5+ would work well for the sort of gritty feel
of the subways. I shot 3 separate rolls of film on 3 different days in May of
2018\. I have chosen 12 of the 23 pictures that I took that I feel fit the scope
of the project.

The intention behind the project was to capture the feeling of the subways,
which I think I was at least partially successful in doing. I think photos 2, 8
and 9 capture some of the dread and uncertainty I, at least used to, feel when
entering one of these. At some point when hunting these things down I began to
realise how quickly they were disappearing, a couple that I photographed were
fenced off and one that I visited had been totally filled in. I was then also
trying to document some of these before they were also demolished. The main
thing that I failed to capture was a human aspect of the subways, although I'm
not sure that photographing people walking through these areas or homeless
people sleeping in them would be more compelling than what I have.

I gave up on the project mostly just because I'd lost interest in it. I visited
almost all of the subways that I managed to find, some a few times, and despite
only shooting 23 images I was starting to feel like there wasn't really any new
compositions left since they're all quite visually similar.
