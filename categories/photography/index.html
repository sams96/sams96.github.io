environmental issue of choice. Not only is it an annoyance to astronomers, but
also damaging to wildlife as well as our health and is a large energy sink. I
have taken particular notice of the amount of light pollution on my university&rsquo;s
campus lately as I am back living on campus after 2 years of living elsewhere,
and my dissertation involves using the telescope on the roof of the physics
building. This is a university that seems to boast about being <em>green</em> but seems
to ignore this aspect of the environment.</p></div><div class=article-date>16 Feb 2019</div></article><article class=post-list><header><h1><a href=/burmese-dogs/>Burmese Dogs</a></h1></header><div class=content><blockquote>"The pariah curs were baying the moon - it was only a quarter full

then not because I feel that the change of camera increased the quality of
images that I was producing but rather I wanted to keep the format consistent
throughout. Also it was about a year after I started shooting film, and when I
started pursuing photography as a hobby.</p></div><div class=article-date>09 Nov 2018</div></article><article class=post-list><header><h1><a href=/subways/>Subways</a></h1></header><div class=content><p>This is the remnants of a failed attempt at a photo project looking at
Birmingham&rsquo;s pedestrian subways. I never really thought it was a very good idea
for a project but I decided to give it a go anyway because I wanted to try
shooting a project and it was the best idea that I had, also the subways are the
sort of thing that I usually like to shoot anyway.</p><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/772aw3 title="Subways 1"><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1875/44447904432_9f203051d9_b.jpg alt="Subways 1"></a></div><div class=article-date>07 Sep 2018</div></article><article class=post-list><header><h1><a href=/post/2018-09-03-scrap/>Scrap Collectors</a></h1></header><div class=content><p><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ss9679/29518221107/in/dateposted/ title="Scrap Collectors"><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1894/29518221107_09a9ff1bfa_b.jpg alt="Scrap Collectors"></a>
I took this photo in Ma Tau Kok, Hong Kong on the way to visit the Kowloon
Walled City Park. I don&rsquo;t really remember much about my intentions behind the
photo beyond <em>this looks cool</em>, although that is how I shoot most of the time.
In hindsight, I would&rsquo;ve liked to have framed slightly to the right to show a
bit more of the truck and a bit less of the side of the building but I think
overall the framing is quite interesting. The depth of field puts a slight
softness on the shop fronts which I think works well to make the two guys on the
trucks stand out a bit as well as giving the road, and that piece of litter, a
more noticeable softness in the foreground. The one guy on the right stands out
really well, framed perfectly in front of the white board, but I think the other
guy, especially his head, blends into the background a bit.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t actually know if they are scrap collectors, but that&rsquo;s what it looks
like to me.</p></div><div class=article-date>03 Sep 2018</div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>© Sam Smith, 2020</p><nav><a href=/categories/ title=Categories>Categories</a>
