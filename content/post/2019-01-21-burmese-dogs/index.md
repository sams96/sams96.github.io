It was on the first night of the 3 day trek from Kalaw to Inle Lake, in a small
hilltop village, at about 4 a.m when, as we discovered later in the morning, we
had all been awoken by the <i>moon-choruses</i> of a group of dogs that must
have been larger than the human population of the town.

This is a series of photos I took with my phone while travelling around Burma
during July 2018. I found the similarities between Burma as I visited it and how
George Orwell wrote about it to be quite interesting, especially with regards to
the dogs.
