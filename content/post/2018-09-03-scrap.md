I took this photo in Ma Tau Kok, Hong Kong on the way to visit the Kowloon
Walled City Park. I don't really remember much about my intentions behind the
photo beyond *this looks cool*, although that is how I shoot most of the time.
In hindsight, I would've liked to have framed slightly to the right to show a
bit more of the truck and a bit less of the side of the building but I think
overall the framing is quite interesting. The depth of field puts a slight
softness on the shop fronts which I think works well to make the two guys on the
trucks stand out a bit as well as giving the road, and that piece of litter, a
more noticeable softness in the foreground. The one guy on the right stands out
really well, framed perfectly in front of the white board, but I think the other
guy, especially his head, blends into the background a bit.

I don't actually know if they are scrap collectors, but that's what it looks
like to me.
