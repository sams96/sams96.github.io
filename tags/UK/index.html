Sadly I
didn&rsquo;t manage to make any progress with getting anything changed on campus, the
person I&rsquo;d emailed didn&rsquo;t get back to me and my exams & dissertation took
precedence so I didn&rsquo;t pursue it any further.</p></div><div class=article-date>24 Jul 2019</div></article><article class=post-list><header><h1><a href=/campus-lights/>Campus Lights</a></h1></header><div class=content><p>As an astronomy student and hobbyist, light pollution has sort of become my
environmental issue of choice. Not only is it an annoyance to astronomers, but
also damaging to wildlife as well as our health and is a large energy sink. I
have taken particular notice of the amount of light pollution on my university&rsquo;s
campus lately as I am back living on campus after 2 years of living elsewhere,
and my dissertation involves using the telescope on the roof of the physics
building. This is a university that seems to boast about being <em>green</em> but seems
to ignore this aspect of the environment.</p></div><div class=article-date>16 Feb 2019</div></article><article class=post-list><header><h1><a href=/subways/>Subways</a></h1></header><div class=content><p>This is the remnants of a failed attempt at a photo project looking at
Birmingham&rsquo;s pedestrian subways. I never really thought it was a very good idea
for a project but I decided to give it a go anyway because I wanted to try
shooting a project and it was the best idea that I had, also the subways are the
sort of thing that I usually like to shoot anyway.</p><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/772aw3 title="Subways 1"><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1875/44447904432_9f203051d9_b.jpg alt="Subways 1"></a></div><div class=article-date>07 Sep 2018</div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>© Sam Smith, 2020</p><nav><a href=/categories/ title=Categories>Categories</a>
